# PySiddhi

The scope of this project is to develop a Python Wrapper on Siddhi Library. The Python wrapper would support Siddhi 4.x. A REST Client is also developed to interact with WSO2 Stream Processor 4.x.x.

This was developed as a project for Google Summer of Code 2017 Program.


Features
-----
- [x] Basic functionalities of Siddhi 4.x.x
- [x] Wrapper on Siddhi Debugger
- [x] Support to Siddhi Extensions Loading
- [x] Rest Client on WSO2 SP 4.x.x - Siddhi App Management
- [x] Rest Client on WSO2 SP 4.x.x Event Simulator
- [x] Deployment wheels

Install PySiddhi from python package manager(pip)

    - Requests (`sudo pip install requests`)
    - Cython (`sudo pip install cython`)
    - Pyjnius (`sudo pip install pyjnius`)
    - Future (`sudo pip install future`)
    - Python Developer Package (`sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev python-dev`)
    - libboost for Python (`sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev`)
    - Maven and Java 8
    - g++ and other development tools
      - `sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ autotools-dev libicu-dev build-essential libbz2-dev libboost-all-dev`
- macOS
    -
    - install brew
    - install python using brew
    - Requests (`sudo pip install requests`)
    - Cython (`sudo pip install cython`)
    - Pyjnius (`sudo pip install pyjnius`)
    - Future (`sudo pip install future`)
    - boost for python (`brew install boost`)


- Download siddhi-sdk release from https://github.com/wso2/siddhi-sdk/releases and set the SIDDHISDK_HOME as a           environment variable(`export SIDDHISDK_HOME="<path-to-siddhi-sdk>"`)
- For use of WSO2 SP 4.x.x Client functionality, it is required to have a WSO2 SP 4.x.x worker instance up and running.
    (Refer _Running the Tests_ section for installation details)
2. Install using Setup.py.
    - Clone the branch from GitHub Repository.
    - Navigate to project root and run `sudo pip install .`

Use the Library using Python
-----
* Siddhi on python
    ```python
    from PySiddhi4.core.SiddhiManager import SiddhiManager
    sm = SiddhiManager()
    ....
    sm.shutdown()
    ```

* Refer Tests to get more familiar with library functionality.

Running the Tests
-----
1. Install pre-requisites mentioned in `Installing the Library from Source` section.
2. Compile Java Libraries.
    - Navigate to `PySiddhi/PySiddhi4Proxy` and run `mvn clean install`
3. For running tests on WSO2 SP 4.x.x , it is required to have WSO2 SP 4.x.x worker instance up and running.
    - Obtain WSO2 SP 4.x.x binary distribution from https://github.com/wso2/product-sp/releases/.
    - Extract `wso2sp-4.x.x.zip` to a suitable location (say `SP_HOME`).
    - Navigate to `SP_Home/bin/` and run `sh worker.sh`(in windows run worker.bat).
4. Run the tests cases in `PySiddhi/Tests` directory

* If mvn clean install throws errors, check the paths provided for imports of Python3 Developer Headers

Creating deployment wheel (for Linux)
-----
1. Install pre-requisites mentioned in `Installing the Library from Source` section.
2. Delete directory `build` if exist.
3. Goto source root and run `python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name manylinux1_x86_64`

_Note: You need to use linux operating system to build linux wheels._

Creating deployment wheel (for Windows)
-----
1. Install pre-requisites mentioned in `Installing the Library from Source` section.
2. Delete directory `build` if exist.
3. Goto source root and run `python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name win-amd64`

_Note: You need to use Windows operating system to build Windows wheels._

Installing deployment wheel
-----
1. Make sure all pre-requisites are met.
(You may have to separately install cython using `pip install cython` if you use _virtual environments_)
2. Install python wheel using `pip install [path_to_wheel_file]`.

Background
-----
Siddhi is a java library that listens to events from data streams, detects complex conditions described via a Streaming SQL language, and triggers actions. It performs both Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing.
